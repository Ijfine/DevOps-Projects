# Ansible-Dynamic-Assignments (Include) and Community Roles

In the [[previous projects](https://github.com/Ijfine/Ansible-Refactoring-Assignments---Imports)], some knowledge and skills have been gained on Ansible which can help you to perform configurations using playbooks, roles and imports.Now we will continue configuring our UAT servers learning and practicing new Ansible concepts and modules.

In this project we will introduce `dynamic assignments` by using `include` module.

What's the difference?

The *static-assignments* use `import` Ansible module while *dynamic assignments* use `include` module.

Hence,

```python
import = Static
include = Dynamic
```
When the `import` module is used, all statements are pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed. Meaning, when you execute *site.yml* playbook, Ansible will process all the playbooks referenced during the time it is parsing the statements. This also means that, during actual execution, if any statement changes, such statements will not be considered. Hence, it is static. On the other hand, when include module is used, all statements are processed only during execution of the playbook. Meaning, after the statements are parsed, any changes to the statements encountered during execution will be used. Take note that in most cases it is recommended to use static assignments for playbooks, because it is more reliable. With dynamic ones, it is hard to debug playbook problems due to its dynamic nature. However, you can use dynamic assignments for environment specific variables as we will be introducing in this project.

# Introducing dynamic assignment into our structure

In your `https://github.com/<your name>/ansible-congif-mgt` GitHub repository, start a new branch and name it `dynamic-assignments`.

![Alt text](Images/dyna.png)

Create a new folder, name it `dynamic-assignments`. Then inside this folder, create a new file and name it `env-vars.yml`. We will instruct `site.yml` to include this playbook later. For now, let us keep building up the structure.

Note: Depending on what method you used in the previous project you may have or not have roles folder in your GitHub repository - if you used ansible-galaxy, then roles directory was only created on your Jenkins-Ansible server locally. It is recommended to have all the codes managed and tracked in GitHub, so you might want to recreate this structure manually in this case we will still be using VS Code.

Now our new folder structure should look like this

```python
├── dynamic-assignments
│   └── env-vars.yml
├── inventory
│   └── dev
    └── stage
    └── uat
    └── prod
└── playbooks
    └── site.yml
└── roles (optional folder)
    └──...(optional subfolders & files)
└── static-assignments
    └── common.yml
```

Since we will be using the same Ansible to configure multiple environments, and each of these environments will have certain unique attributes, such as servername, ip-address etc., we will need a way to set values to variables per specific environment. For this reason, we will now create a folder to keep each environment's variables file. Therefore, create a new folder *env-vars*, then for each environment, create new YAML files which we will use to set variables. Your layout should now look like this.

```python
├── dynamic-assignments
│   └── env-vars.yml
├── env-vars
    └── dev.yml
    └── stage.yml
    └── uat.yml
    └── prod.yml
├── inventory
    └── dev
    └── stage
    └── uat
    └── prod
├── playbooks
    └── site.yml
└── static-assignments
    └── common.yml
    └── webservers.yml
```
![Alt text](Images/env.png)

Now paste the instruction below into the env-vars.yml file.

```python
---
- name: collate variables from env specific file, if it exists
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: looping through list of available files
      include_vars: "{{ item }}"
      with_first_found:
        - files:
            - dev.yml
            - stage.yml
            - prod.yml
            - uat.yml
          paths:
            - "{{ playbook_dir }}/../env-vars"
      tags:
        - always
```
![Alt text](Images/envyml.png)

Notice 3 things to notice here:

1. We used `include_vars` syntax instead of `include`, this is because Ansible developers decided to separate different features of the module. From Ansible version 2.8, the `include` module is deprecated and variants of `include`_* must be used. These are:

- `include_role`
- `include_tasks`
- `include_vars`
In the same version, variants of import were also introduces, such as:

- `import_role`
- `import_tasks`

2. We made use of a special variables *{{ playbook_dir }}* and *{{ inventory_file }}*. *{{ playbook_dir }}* will help Ansible to determine the location of the running playbook, and from there navigate to other path on the filesystem. *{{ inventory_file }}* on the other hand will dynamically resolve to the name of the inventory file being used, then append .yml so that it picks up the required file within the `env-vars` folder. 

3. We are including the variables using a loop. with_first_found implies that, looping through the list of files, the first one found is used. This is good so that we can always set default values in case an environment specific env file does not exist.

# Update site.yml with Dynamic Assignments

Update `site.yml` file to make use of the dynamic assignment.

It should contain the following - 

```python
---
- hosts: all
- name: Include dynamic variables 
  tasks:
  import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml 
  include: ../dynamic-assignments/env-vars.yml
  tags:
    - always

-  hosts: webservers
- name: Webserver assignment
  import_playbook: ../static-assignments/webservers.yml
```

# Community Roles

Now it is time to create a role for MySQL database - it should install the MySQL package, create a database and configure users. But why should we re-invent the wheel? There are tons of roles that have already been developed by other open source engineers out there. These roles are actually production ready, and dynamic to accomodate most of Linux flavours. With Ansible Galaxy again, we can simply download a ready to use ansible role, and keep going.

Download Mysql Ansible Role

You can browse available community roles [here](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/)

We will be using a MySQL role developed by [geerlingguy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/roles/geerlingguy/mysql/).

On Jenkins-Ansible server make sure that git is installed with `git --version`, then go to '`ansible-config-mgt`' directory and run

```python
git pull https://github.com/<your-name>/ansible-config-mgt.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-name>/ansible-config-mgt.git
git branch roles-feature
git switch roles-feature
```

Inside `roles` directory create your new MySQL role with `ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.mysql` and rename the folder to mysql using :

```python
sudo ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.mysql
```

`mv geerlingguy.mysql/ mysql`

![Alt text](Images/roles.png)
![Alt text](Images/roles2.png)

Read `README.md` file, and edit roles configuration to use correct credentials for MySQL required for the `tooling` website.

From roles, update the defaults/main.yml file with the following using

`vi roles/mysql/defaults/main.yml`

```python
# Databases.
mysql_databases:
   - name: tooling
     collation: utf8_general_ci
     encoding: utf8
     replicate: 1


# Users.
mysql_users: 
   - name: webaccess
     host: 0.0.0.0
     password: secret
     priv: '*.*:ALL,GRANT'
```
![Alt text](Images/tooling.png)

Update static-assignments with

`db.yml file` (create a new file)

![Alt text](Images/mys.png)

Now create a Pull Request and merge changes to main branch on GitHub with the following commands

```python
git add .
git commit -m "Commit new role files into GitHub"
git push --set-upstream origin roles-feature
```

# Load Balancer roles

We want to be able to choose which Load Balancer to use, Nginx or Apache, so we need to have two roles respectively:

1. Nginx
2. Apache

With our experience on Ansible so far you can:

- Decide if you want to develop your own roles, or find available ones from the community
- Update both `static-assignment` and `site.yml` files to refer the roles

Creating Nginx and Apache roles

Go to your Jenkins-Ansible server.

Inside roles directory create your new Nginx and Apache role with this command

```python
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.nginx
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.apache
```
![Alt text](Images/gnginx.png)

Then rename the folders to nginx and apache respectively with the commands:

```python
mv geerlingguy.nginx/ nginx
mv geerlingguy.apache/ apache
```

# Configuring Apache & Nginx role

Read the README.md file, and edit the roles configuration to use correct credentials for Nginx & Apache as follows:

# Ngnix

From nginx folder in roles:

- update the defaults/main.yml file with this below:

```python
nginx_upstreams: 
 - name: myapp1
   strategy: "ip_hash" # "least_conn", etc.
   keepalive: 16 # optional
   servers: {
       "web1 weight=3",
       "web2 weight=3"
     }

nginx_log_format: |
  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
  '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
  '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"'

enable_nginx_lb: false
load_balancer_is_required: false
```
![Alt text](Images/nups.png)

Update `handlers/main.yml` with this:

```python
---
- name: restart nginx
  become: yes
  service: name=nginx state=restarted

- name: validate nginx configuration
  become: yes
  command: nginx -t -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  changed_when: false

- name: reload nginx
  become: yes
  service: name=nginx state=reloaded
```

![Alt text](Images/handlers.png)

Update `tasks/main.yml` with this:

```python
# Vhost configuration.
- import_tasks: vhosts.yml

- name: set webservers host name in /etc/hosts
  become: yes
  blockinfile:
    path: /etc/hosts
    block: "{{ item.ip }} {{ item.name }}"
  loop:
    - { name: "web1", ip: "172.31.20.10" }
    - { name: "web2", ip: "172.31.19.72" }
    
    
# Nginx setup.
- name: Copy nginx configuration in place.
  become: true
  template:
    src: "{{ nginx_conf_template }}"  
    dest: "{{ nginx_conf_file_path }}"
    owner: root
    group: "{{ root_group }}"
    mode: 0644
  notify:
    - reload nginx

- name: Ensure nginx service is running as configured.
  become: true
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: "{{ nginx_service_state }}"
    enabled: "{{ nginx_service_enabled }}"
```
![Alt text](Images/task.png)

# Apache

From apache folder in roles, update the `defaults/main.yml` file with this below:

```python
# Apache package state; use `present` to make sure it's installed, or `latest`
# if you want to upgrade or switch versions using a new repo.
apache_packages_state: present

enable_apache_lb: false
load_balancer_is_required: false

#webservers
loadbalancer_name: "myapp1"
web1: "private-ip weight=3"
web2: "private-ip weight=3"
```
![Alt text](Images/apa.png)

Important Hints:

- Since we cannot use both Nginx and Apache load balancer, you need to add a condition to enable either one - this is where you can make use of variables.

- Declare a variable in `defaults/main.yml` file inside the Nginx and Apache roles. Name each variables `enable_nginx_lb` and `enable_apache_lb` respectively.

- Set both values to false like this `enable_nginx_lb: false` and `enable_apache_lb: false`.

- Declare another variable in both roles `load_balancer_is_required` and set its value to `false` as well

- Update static-assignments folder with the file (create a new file) `loadbalancers.yml` and update content of `site.yml` (in the playbook folder) file as shown below:

```python
- hosts: lb
  roles:
    - { role: nginx, when: enable_nginx_lb and load_balancer_is_required }
    - { role: apache, when: enable_apache_lb and load_balancer_is_required }
```
![Alt text](Images/lbyml.png)

![Alt text](Images/lbhost.png)

Update site.yml file with:

```python
---
- name: importing common file
  become: true
  import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml
  tags:
    - always

- name: uat-webserver assignment
  import_playbook: ../static-assignments/uat-webservers.yml

- name: include env-vars file
  import_playbook: ../dynamic-assignments/env-vars.yml
  tags:
     - always

- name: import db files
  import_playbook: ../static-assignments/db.yml

- name: Loadbalancers assignment
  import_playbook: ../static-assignments/loadbalancers.yml
  when: load_balancer_is_required 
```

![Alt text](Images/yml.png)
   
Now you can make use of `env-vars\uat.yml` file to define which loadbalancer to use in UAT environment by setting respective environmental variable to `true`.

You will activate load balancer, and enable nginx by setting these in the respective environment's env-vars file.

So paste the code below in the `env-vars\uat.yml`

````python
enable_nginx_lb: true
load_balancer_is_required: true
````
![Alt text](Images/evars.png)

The same must work with apache LB, so you can switch it by setting respective environmental variable to `true` and other to `false`.

To test this, you can update inventory for each environment and run Ansible against each environment.

```python
ansible-playbook -i inventory/uat.yml playbooks/site.yml
```

**Congratulations!**

We have learned and implemented how to use Ansible configuration management tool to prepare UAT environment for Tooling web solution executind dynamic assignments using the `include` module.
